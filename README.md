# Uncovering bias in the PlantVillage dataset

This repository contains the code for the arXiv preprint [Uncovering bias in the PlantVillage dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04374). The PlantVillage dataset used in this analysis can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset/tree/master/raw/color).

### Abstract
We report our investigation on the use of the popular PlantVillage dataset for training deep learning based plant disease detection models. We trained a machine learning model using only 8 pixels from the PlantVillage image backgrounds. The model achieved 49.0% accuracy on the held-out test set, well above the random guessing accuracy of 2.6%. This result indicates that the PlantVillage dataset contains noise correlated with the labels and deep learning models can easily exploit this bias to make predictions. Possible approaches to alleviate this problem are discussed.
